1,SBF,"7) Because it would all be on-chain, it would be trivial to integrate the following into Twitter:

a) tips/payments/monetization for content creators

b) NFTs/profiles/avatars

c) sure, why not DOGE https://t.co/btc8Dz0uUL",Thu Apr 14 12:58:10 +0000 2022,74,703
2,SBF,"4) Tweets about BTC became tweets about DOGE, and we didn't bat an eye.

The world's most prominent businessman was tweeting about our industry.

If DOGE is what brings him joy, then fuck it, it brings us joy too. https://t.co/568UZQlvlY",Fri May 14 04:54:53 +0000 2021,8,235

4,SBF,"Congrats on being the #1 pick @Trevorlawrencee!

We've got a surprise for you -- check your @blockfolio account for $25k of SOL.

Tonight is on crypto, thanks to you! https://t.co/ci8yHp3e8W",Fri Apr 30 00:26:51 +0000 2021,223,1770

6,SBF,".@VitalikButerin want to pitch some of your $SHIB to the FTX Foundation (https://t.co/GItZR05BJc)?

I'd chuck in some tokens too!",Tue May 11 03:18:36 +0000 2021,42,533
7,SBF,"2) For years, we were entertained by @elonmusk.

""Here is a meme"", he said, ""in which I like bitcoin"".

""Yes"", we replied, ""this one sparks joy"". https://t.co/b1oIqusbwM",Fri May 14 04:54:51 +0000 2021,12,232
8,SBF,"sure, why not :)

@Cameron84575538, I just sent 50k DOGE to your @blockfolio account",Fri Apr 16 01:47:05 +0000 2021,115,1805
9,SBF,"AFAIK, @FTX_Official is the only major CEX with deposits and withdrawals open for SHIB!

10,SBF,"guys you can stop retweeting about this now, I've confirmed what's happened and am communicating directly with @hophopcoin",Mon Aug 16 18:50:58 +0000 2021,24,491
11,SBF,"16) Once again, FTX had a record day, with $30B in volume.

(See March 12th on that graph?  What is that, volume for ants?) https://t.co/ig3OSUXgu3",Mon Apr 19 13:13:54 +0000 2021,11,239
12,SBF,"The answer: @blockfolio activity.

Blockfolio users love DOGE, and DOGE traders love Blockfolio!",Mon Apr 19 18:32:41 +0000 2021,16,215
13,SBF,"feels like we might need another URGENT announcement that DOGE trading on @blockfolio and @FTX_Official is online and stuff, like always",Fri Apr 16 08:55:26 +0000 2021,15,355
14,SBF,"https://t.co/lwfQkfumz5 still exists too; KSHIB is meant to deal with the 99,999,999 contracts/order limit on FTX",Tue Oct 26 22:59:45 +0000 2021,5,92
15,SBF,"9) What is value, really, but a meme that we endorse?

Well, that's not quite fair.

Bread has value.  As shelter, and water, and music, and maybe math.

But gold, and dollars, and NFTs, and super bowls, and TSLA, and DOGE are all worth whatever we think they are.",Fri May 14 04:54:55 +0000 2021,20,310
16,SBF,"A bunch more coins were just added as collateral and to spot margin!

BAND, ALPHA, BADGER, BAO, REN, RRAY, BNT, ZRRX, FTM, and KIN are now all usable as collateral on FTX.",Wed Mar 03 10:22:15 +0000 2021,81,943
17,SBF,"10) He doesn't choose DOGE in spite of it having no intrinsic value.

He chooses it _because_ it's just a meme.  Because so many things are, and so really, what makes DOGE any less real?",Fri May 14 04:54:56 +0000 2021,6,189
18,SBF,"7) Partially, I have to think, it's because @elonmusk is bored.

It's too easy, sometimes, to play everyone else's game.  Sometimes you have to shake it up a bit to keep things interesting.

But partially, the fact that DOGE is a meme is the whole point of it.",Fri May 14 04:54:54 +0000 2021,16,344
19,SBF,"5) DOGE boomed, and we rejoiced, and the media watched, perplexed.

I sometimes feel like the world is divided, these days, into people who understand memes and people who don't.

""But @elonmusk, DOGE is a joke!  Why do you endorse it?""

Says someone who does not understand Elon.",Fri May 14 04:54:54 +0000 2021,10,221
20,SBF,"16) Blockchains allow anyone to create a wallet and use it to send and receive tokens--including USD pegged stablecoins.

Those payments take seconds to process, cost fractions of a penny, and are finalized in less than a minute.

No long wait, no account balance uncertainty.",Sat Jul 16 13:04:03 +0000 2022,46,690
